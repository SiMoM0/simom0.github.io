## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/), at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/). I obtained my Master Degree in *Computer Engineering - Artificial Intelligence and Robotics* in 2023 at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) and my Bachelor Degree in *Computer Engineering* in 2021 at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/).

I also developed simple Android apps and published them on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=9156799026580612705).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **3D perception**, with particular interest in 3D reconstruction and 3D data interpretation for autonomous vehicles and UAVs.

<!-- **3D Perception:** 3D Semantic Segmentation, Point Cloud -->
<!-- - **Deep Learning:** semantic segmentation, classification -->
